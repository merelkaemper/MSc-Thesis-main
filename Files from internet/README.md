# MSc-Thesis - Files from internet
In this folder you find 3 different files that are used to create the distance overview between stations and the population overview of the cities in which the stations are located. These are found on:

1. https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/en (stations-2023-09.csv; tariff-distances-2022-01)
2. https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/visualisaties/dashboard-bevolking/regionaal/inwoners (population-nl.csv)

These files are used in the Exploratory Data Analysis notebook and the Data Processing notebook to create the outputs that can be found in the data folder.
